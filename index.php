     <p > Digital libraries were viewed as systems providing a community of users with coherent access to a large, organized repository of information and knowledge. One group made the provocative proposal that this organization of information was characterized by the absence of prior detailed knowledge of the uses of the information. The ability of the user to access, reorganize, and utilize this repository is enriched by the capabilities of digital technology.</p>

<p>Digital libraries are for the foreseeable future need to span both print and digital materials and that the central issue was to provide a coherent view of a very large collection of information. In this sense, an emphasis on content solely in digital format is too limiting. Really, the objective is to develop information systems providing access to a coherent collection of material, more and more of which will be in digital format as time goes on, and to fully exploit the opportunities that are offered by the materials that are in digital formats. Additionally, the comprehensiveness and value of the collection accessible through a digital library system can be strengthened by the ability to integrate materials in digital formats that have not been well represented, easy to access, or effectively usable in traditional library collections, such as multimedia, geospatial data, or numerical datasets.</p>
